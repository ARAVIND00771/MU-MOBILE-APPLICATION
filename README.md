## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mahindra-university-app.git
cd mahindra-university-app
```

### 2. Firebase Setup
- Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Enable Firestore and Authentication (Email/Password or other providers as needed).
- Download the Firebase Admin SDK service account key and place it as `backend/service-account.json` (do **not** commit this file to version control).
- Update Firestore rules and indexes as needed (see `firestore.rules` and `firestore.indexes.json`).

### 3. Install Dependencies
#### Frontend
```bash
npm install
```
#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 4. Run the App
#### Frontend (React Native)
```bash
npm run dev
```
#### Backend (Express.js)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## System Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:
1. **Frontend**: React Native mobile app
2. **Backend**: Express.js server
3. **Database**: Firebase Firestore
4. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
5. **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Realtime Database
6. **Maps Integration**: Google Maps API

## Security Measures
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure API endpoints
- Encrypted data transmission
- Protected service account credentials

## Notes
- The project uses **Firebase Firestore** for all backend data storage
- Do **not** share your `service-account.json` file publicly. Add it to `.gitignore`
- For Firestore data structure and example documents, see the backend code and Firestore Console
- For any issues, check the backend/README.md for more details on API endpoints and environment variables

## Evaluation Information
This project was developed as part of the Software Engineering course at Mahindra University. The implementation follows best practices in software development, including:
- Agile development methodology
- Continuous integration and testing
- Documentation-driven development
- Security-first approach
- Scalable architecture design
